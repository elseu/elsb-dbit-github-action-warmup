Github action to start an instance in ASG if desired is 0

This script can process several ASG at time using following :

- python warmup.py <AsgName1> wAsgName2> <AsgName3> ....

- python warmup.py SphinxJobs-LarbizSphinxWebserviceStack-TLPCMLE9W6H7-ScalingGroup-1VB3HTY0H0CU4

If desired is at 0 in ASG, we update to 1 and we are waiting for "InService"  instance's status.
We process each ASG passed in args until each one have a running instance.

If desired is up to 0, we just ignore ASG
